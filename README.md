# IPL Player Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing IPL player performance (Virat Kohli) using data analysis techniques.
The goal is to evaluate player consistency, strike rate, and overall impact using Python and Power BI.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub
- Power BI (for dashboard visualization)

## Dataset
The analysis uses IPL ball-by-ball and match-level datasets.

## Project Structure
- data/ → Raw and processed datasets
- notebooks/ → Data analysis notebooks
- visuals/ → Exported charts
- powerbi/ → Power BI dashboard
- README.md → Project documentation

## Status
The analysis is concluded and the Power BI dashboard is ready for visualization.
Python is used for data cleaning and processing raw data.


## key insights 
- Total Runs: 4423
- Average Strike Rate: 126.59
- Runs Per Ball: 1.27
- (The dataset contain ipl 2008 to 2017 data so the data may be innacurate according to todays time)
